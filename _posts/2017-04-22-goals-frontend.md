title: Goals as a Frontend Developer
---

After completing the frontend portion of Bloc, I would like to be able to build websites and applications for clients with ease. I hope that with my experience at Bloc I will be able to build products for myself or clients with little to no bugs. I hope that with the course, I will be able to gain experience with UX design, so that the products are easy to use and well-designed.
