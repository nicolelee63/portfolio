title: 1 Year Anniversary of Being a Working Adult
---
Growing up, I had a lot of hobbies and extra-curricular activities. I participated in team sports for ice hockey, tennis, soccer, basketball, rugby, field and field hockey. I joined musicals, played music in different clubs, and even had my own band with my friends.

I had a knack for learning new languages. At the age of 4, I started learning English and Mandarin simultaneously. By the time I was in 5th grade, I added French to the list of languages I was learning for my school’s curriculum. In college, I continued French and I picked up a beginner Spanish class for my last semester. For fun, I learned some German online for a couple of weeks. It was enough for me to get by Berlin strictly using German.

Currently as a working adult, I have little time to practice my language skills. I bought a beautiful second-hand saxophone not too long ago but I’ve only had time to play it a few times. Since coming back to Hong Kong, I've been playing in a dodgeball league. This season I played for four teams, and regrettably, I will not be able to do the same in the future.

I am slowly beginning to realize that as a working adult, free time is a true luxury. It was something I took for granted back in college and highschool because there was so much free time. Some days I could start a little later and finish around 7 or 8, but some days I could start as early as 8 and work until the next morning.

I hope that in the coming weeks, I will be more organized with my work and schedule to fit in activities that I enjoy doing.
